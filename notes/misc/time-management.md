# Time Management

These two articles describe the two systems I used to stay organized and
productive, but the main rules I follow are:

- Have an information inbox that I check daily and process into actions or
  reference.
- Have a place to put next actions that I am planning on completing in the next
  week, and review this daily to plan my tasks for the day.
- Have a place to put actions that I won't complete until at least a week away,
  and review this weekly.
- Try to organize tasks by context (location or required materials) and time
  required.
- Work on only one thing at a time for 25 minutes, then reevaluate if I still
  think I am working on the most important thing I should be working on. Repeat.
