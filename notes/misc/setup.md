# Setup

* * *

Some of the following tools require the use of the terminal (Terminal.app). This
can be quite overwhelming if you've never used it before, but don't worry,
you'll soon grow comfortable with it.

## Development Tools

### Install script

A custom [install
script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TIY-GVL-FEE-2015-May/notes/master/files/install-script.sh)
can be used to install all of the developer tools you will need for the class.
To run the install script:


1. Open Terminal.app
2. In the terminal, type `xcode-select --install` and follow the on screen
   instructions.
3. Download [the
   script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TIY-GVL-FEE-2015-May/notes/master/files/install-script.sh)
   to your Desktop by going to File > Save As and saving it as
   `install-script.sh` on your Desktop.
4. In the terminal, navigate to your Desktop by typing `cd ~/Desktop` at the
   prompt
5. Make the script runnable by typing `chmod 755 install-script.sh` at the
   prompt (this won't produce any visible change).
6. Run the script by typing `./install-script.sh` at the prompt.

### [Github](http://github.com)

GitHub is a web-based hosting and communication service for software
development projects that use the Git revision control system. [Sign up for an
account.](https://github.com/join)

Make sure to add a profile picture and your full name, since this will help me
learn your name.

### [CodePen](http://codepen.io/)
CodePen is an HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code editor in your browser with
instant previews. We will use this in class for demonstrations.

You may sign up for your own account if you would like.

### Creating an SSH key

You'll need an SSH key when using Github. SSH keys are a way to identify trusted
computers, without involving passwords. Walk through the steps in the following
tutorial to create your SSH key and add it to your Github account:

throughout the class for homework review and debugging during the lectures.
