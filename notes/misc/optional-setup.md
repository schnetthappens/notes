# Optional Setup

* * *

## Pinboard
You will receive a ridiculous number of URLs during the course, so you may want
to sign up for a bookmark application. Personally, I use http://pinboard.in,
though it is not free. It allows you to tag, annotate, and organize all your
bookmarks and I have found it to be very useful.

## Instapaper
Another application you may find handy is http://instapaper.com. It is a "read
later" service, of which there are many. It is a great way to keep track of
reading and sync articles to your phone to read on the go.

## Configuration

### Change Caps Lock to Control
Many keyboard shortcuts in Atom, Chrome, etc. require the use of the Control
key. However, the Control key is a little bit difficult to reach, so many
developers remap their Caps Lock and Control keys. Try this for a while and see
if you can get used to it.

1. Go to  -> System Preferences -> Keyboard
2. Click on "Modifier Keys..."
3. Change "Caps Lock (⇪) Key" to "^ Control"
4. Change "Control (^) Key" to "⇪ Caps Lock"

P.S. If you decide not to do this, and ask me for help where I have to type on
your computer, I will probably accidentally type A BUNCH OF UPPERCASE STUFF
because I'll forget that Caps Lock isn't switched.

### [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh)

This will change the default shell for your Terminal.app. This is a pretty
advanced piece of software, so feel free to dig into the documentation if you
feel up to it. For our purposes, though, this will automatically show you some
information about git like the current branch, so if you just type the line
below into Terminal.app, it will give you a nicer looking command line.

```sh
curl -L http://install.ohmyz.sh | sh
```
