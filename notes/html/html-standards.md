# Standard HTML
- HTML5 is the current HTML standard
- The doctype tells the browser what version of HTML you're using
- The HTML standard is a "living standard", which means that the standard will
  change to incorporate new features and updates.
- The `<meta>` tag in the `<head>` element tells the browser additional
  information about a web page such as the content type and character encoding.
- The charset attribute of the `<meta>` tag tells the browser the character
  encoding that is used for the web page.
- Most web pages use the utf-8 encoding for HTML files, and for the `<meta>` tag
  charset attribute.
- The validator at http://html5.validator.nu is a free online service that
  checks pages for compliance with standards.
