# Git basics
See [Is Git the Same Thing as Github!?](http://www.jahya.net/blog/?2013-05-git-vs-github)

To use the basics of git, you can think of it as a photo booth. It takes a
snapshot of your project at a certain point in time, but it will only snapshot
the things you have placed in the "staging area" (the booth, in this analogy).

## Creating a repository on your computer
This creates a git repository in the current directory.

```sh
git init .
```

## Adding files to the staging area

To see the current status of your directory and repository:

```sh
$ git status
```

To track *all* files in the current directory. You can do this by adding the
current directory.

```sh
$ git add .
```

## Checking the status
```sh
$ git status
```

## Committing files
Now that you have files in the staging area, you can save a snapshot of the staging area using a commit.

```
$ git commit -m "Message"
[master 7b84c79] Fix font in index.html
1 file changed, 12 insertions(+), 2 deletions(-)
```

## Summary

```sh
# add some files
$ git add .
$ git commit
$ git push
# or `git push -u origin master` if it is the first time you're pushing
```
